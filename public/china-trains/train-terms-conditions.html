        24 hours ago before your train departure time. CTT will be not responsible for not get the tickets in the end.

        80% refund of the tickets face price before train departs. (80% refund is not CTT selling price, but the face price's. The lose will be on your own responsibility ) </p>

Since we have express delivered the tickets to your hotel and we can not get them back to cancel at train station in time, but you could get it and cancel at train station by yourself. There are different cancellation policies. If you cancel the tickets out of 48 hour before the train departure time, then you will get a 95% face price form the train authorities; if you cancel the tickets between 48 hours and 24 hours before the train departure time, then you can get a 90% face price form the train authorities; if you cancel the tickets with 24 hours before the train departure time, then you can get a 80% face price form the train authorities.

If you can not go to train station to cancel the tickets, we can send our guy to pick up it at your hotel and cancel it for you at train station, but it is USD 80 per time for the service. Service charge will be deducted from the refund. Cancellation made by clients out of 7 days (168 hours) for final confirmed bookings, the cancellation charge is 40% of CTT selling price, (Since our guys have to go to train stations to cancel your bookings ) you can get a 60% refund of the CTT selling price. Clients must provide the passport copies or scans for all passengers which are necessary to make the cancellation. If not provide above copies before 7 days, CTT can not refund any payment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>10: Change Policy:</strong><br />
        If the clients want to change the departure date before issuing date, CTT will help to reissue the new tickets without receiving any charge. If passed the issuing date, tickets have been issued, you have to cancel the booking and issue a new one.  So it's the same with cancellation policy. But CTT may not ensure you to get the new tickets, it depends on the train tickets status.</p>
        <p><strong>11. For Seats and Sleepers</strong><br />
        Seat, Hard Sleeper, Soft Sleeper, Deluxe Cabin: Deluxe Cabins-2 person stay inside with 2 sleepers. Soft Sleeper - 4 person inside with 4 sleepers. Hard Sleeper - in one car without too much private. Seat divided by soft seat and hard seat. We provide tickets probably in same cabin, but can not ensure it. There will be the risk that clients maybe stay in the different car in some occasions like peak season of Chinese Spring Festival, National Day Holiday etc. If you select the alternative Trains and Seat category, we will change the train tickets for you automatically. Sleepers to Sleepers, Seats to Seats. And the trains time difference will be considered by our professional staff. If you select doesn’t accept any change of the seats and trains, we will not change it. We will try our best to buy all your sleepers in one car or one room but CTT can not ensure you on this issue. CTT can help you to write a note to Chinese attendant and they may change the tickets for you with others. <br />
